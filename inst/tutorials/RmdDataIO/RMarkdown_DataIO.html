<h2>General Instructions</h2>
<p>While you work through this tutorial, you will create an R Markdown (.Rmd) document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and Word documents that include R code and results.</p>
<p>It’s like magic: you save all your text and R code in a simple file; when you’re ready, push a button and it’s compiled into an output document with nicely formatted text, code (optional to include, but for this class you always will), and <strong>all the figures and tables generated by your code</strong>.</p>
<p>Since all the data analysis and results are automatically included in the compiled output document, your work is <em>reproducible</em> and it’s easy to re-do analysis if the data change, or if a mistake is uncovered. For more details on using R Markdown see <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.</p>
<p>To create an Rmd file, you will have to work in RStudio (outside this tutorial environment). So, as you work on this tutorial, you will probably switch back and forth between the tutorial itself and a “real” RStudio session.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-logging-in-to-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Logging in to RStudio</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="http://rstudio.calvin.edu" class="uri">http://rstudio.calvin.edu</a> and enter your normal Calvin user name and password to log in.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-panels" class="section level2">
<h2>Panels</h2>
<p>When you open RStudio, you will see at least three different panels: The <em>Console</em> is on the left. On the upper right are <em>Environment</em>, <em>History</em> and maybe more; on the lower right are <em>Files</em>, <em>Plots</em>, and <em>Packages</em>. Explore a little to try to get familiar with them!</p>
<p><em>Files</em> shows you the files saved in your personal space on the server. You can organize, upload, and delete files and folders.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-executing-code-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Executing code in R</h2>
<p>You can <em>do</em> things in R by typing commands in the <em>Console</em> panel; however, working that way makes it hard to keep a record of your work (and hard to redo things if anything changes or if a mistake was made). For this class, you will work in R markdown files, which can contain text, R code, and R output (such as figures).</p>
<p>After you have opened a file (like an RMarkdown file) on the RStudio server, the <em>Console</em> panel will be on the lower left and the newly opened file will be on the top left.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-r-markdown-files-are-stand-alone" class="section level2">
<h2>R Markdown files are stand-alone!</h2>
<p>Every R Markdown file (Rmd file) must be completely stand-alone. It doesn’t share any information with the <em>Console</em> or the <em>Environment</em> that you see in your RStudio session. <strong>All</strong> R code that you need to do whatever you are trying to do must be included in the Rmd file itself!</p>
<p>For example, if you use the point-and-click user interface in the RStudio <em>Environment</em> tab to import a data file, the read-in dataset will <em>not</em> be available for use within your Rmd file.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you load a package by typing</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(mosaic)</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(mosaic)</code></pre>
<p>in the <em>Console</em> window, <code>mosaic</code> functions and data <strong>will not be available to use within the Rmd file.</strong></p>
<p>Keep your Rmd files stand-alone! (You have no choice, actually…)</p>
</div>
<div id="section-create-an-r-markdown-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Create an R Markdown file</h2>
<p>In RStudio, navigate to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown…, or click on the white rectangle with a green + :</p>
<p><img src="images/NewRmdFile.jpg" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>and select R Markdown from the drop-down menu.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-markdown-templates" class="section level2">
<h2>Markdown Templates</h2>
<p>Choose “From Template” and select the “STAT 145 Homework” template. (This template has all the basics pre-set to make it easy to complete homework and projects in RStudio.) In case you don’t see this option available, you can also select the “mosaic fancy” (which includes lots of examples to show you what Rmd can do) or “mosaic plain” (less boilerplate content) template.</p>
<p><img src="images/MosaicFancy.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-save-your-rmd-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Save your Rmd file</h2>
<p>Save your file by clicking on the disk icon at the top of the file tab (maybe give it a useful file name like DeRuiterProject1.Rmd. <strong>Important:</strong> <em>Avoid spaces and special characters in your file name</em>). <strong>The file will be saved to the server, not to your computer.</strong> All your files will be accessible in the RStudio <em>Files</em> tab (lower right panel) whenever you log into RStudio, regardless of which computer you are using.</p>
<p><img src="images/FileTab.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-downloading-files-from-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Downloading files from RStudio</h2>
<p>However, you will have to download your files if you want a copy on your own computer, or to be able to upload a copy to Moodle to turn in. To download, go to the <em>File</em> tab, check the box for the file you want, then select More - Export. from the menu at the top of the <em>File</em> tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/Export.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-knit" class="section level2">
<h2>Knit!</h2>
<p>How do Rmd files actually work? What’s so cool about them?</p>
<p>Click on the <em>small black arrow</em> next to the word “Knit” (and the ball of yard icon) at the top of the file window. Select “Knit to PDF”. Check out the compiled PDF result, and compare it to the original markdown file. Wow!</p>
<p><img src="images/KnitButton.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-personalize-your-markdown-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Personalize your Markdown file</h2>
<p>At the top of the markdown file, enter an appropriate title, author(s), and date (within the quotation marks). Knit again to see the effect.</p>
<p>Make sure you do this for every assignment! (No prof likes getting homework from “A. Student” or “Your Name Here”…)</p>
<p><img src="images/Title.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-rmd-file-anatomy-text" class="section level2">
<h2>Rmd file anatomy: Text</h2>
<p>The R Markdown file is a text file where you save all the R commands you want to use, plus any text commenting on the work you are doing and the results you get. Parts of the file with a plain white background are normal text.</p>
<p>You can format the text. For example, enclosing a word in asterisks will generate italics, so *my text* in the Rmd file will become <em>my text</em> in the PDF. Using two asterisks instead of one will generate boldface, so **my text** becomes <strong>my text</strong>. You can also make bulleted lists, numbered lists, section headers, and more. For example,</p>
<p>### Some Text</p>
<p>becomes</p>
<div id="section-some-text" class="section level3">
<h3>Some Text</h3>
<p>(a sub-section header). Fewer hashtags make the text even larger, and more make it smaller.</p>
<p>Check out the R Markdown cheat sheet <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf" class="uri">https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf</a> for more examples.</p>
<p>For instructions on how to include R output and special characters (symbols, subscripts, etc.) in your text, see the document in the “Links and Resources” section of the course Moodle site.</p>
<p>Before moving on, try a few of the tricks you just learned in your Rmd file. Make it pretty!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-rmd-file-anatomy-r-code-chunks" class="section level2">
<h2>Rmd file anatomy: R code chunks</h2>
<p>An Rmd file can also contain one or more <strong>R code chunks.</strong> These sections of the file have a grey background onscreen. Each one begins with</p>
<p>```{r}</p>
<p>and ends with</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>like so:</p>
<p><img src="images/CodeChunk.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-how-to-add-a-new-r-code-chunk-to-your-file" class="section level2">
<h2>How to add a new R code chunk to your file</h2>
<p>To add a code chunk to your file, you can type in the header and footer by hand to start and end the chunk. Or, you can click on the green box with the C inside (at the top of the Rmd file) to insert an empty chunk. When you click the <strong>Knit</strong> button a document will be generated that includes both text content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.</p>
<p><img src="images/InsertCodeChunk.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-setup-chunk" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup Chunk</h2>
<p>The first R code chunk in a Rmd file is usually used to specify settings. In this chunk, you can also give R permission to use certain packages (software toolkits) with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(packagename) </code></pre>
<p>Alternatively,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(packagename)</code></pre>
<p>does the same thing.</p>
<p>For example, we will almost always use the mosaic package. So, verify that the first R code chunk in your file includes the line <code>library(mosaic)</code> or <code>require(mosaic)</code> (both options work equally well).</p>
<p><img src="images/SettingsChunk.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-settings-chunk-is-invisible" class="section level2">
<h2>The settings chunk is invisible!</h2>
<p>If you look carefully at the PDF output, you will see that the settings chunk does <em>not</em> appear there. That’s intentional - for homework, you don’t need to show me what settings you used, although <strong>I would always like the R code you use to solve problems to show up in the output PDF.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="section-making-r-code-invisible-in-the-pdf" class="section level2">
<h2>Making R code invisible in the PDF</h2>
<p>Going back to the Rmd file, look at the header of the settings chunk – this is the part between the {curly braces}. Notice that in addition to the required “r” label, which is followed by an (optional) chunk name, the option</p>
<p><code>include=FALSE</code></p>
<p>appears, which is what makes the code from this chunk invisible in your compiled output document.</p>
<p><strong>Please do not use this option for the R code you use to make calculations in your projects and homework.</strong> I want to see exactly what code you used to get your results!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-are-there-other-options-i-can-set" class="section level2">
<h2>Are there other options I can set?</h2>
<p>You can add other options for R chunks (we will learn about some more choices later) and they should all be separated by commas. You can control things like what is included in the output PDF and how big figures are in the PDF. For this class, the defaults defined in the mosaic plain and fancy templates will work well most of the time.</p>
<p>If interested, see <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf</a> or <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf" class="uri">http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-clean-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Clean Up</h2>
<p>At this point, you probably want to get rid of all the extra content in the template.</p>
<p>Delete <strong>everything</strong> in the file that comes <em>after</em> the settings R code chunk.</p>
<p>Now the clutter is gone and you have space to include your own R code and text.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-running-r-code-from-an-rmd-file-knit-the-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Running R Code from an Rmd file: Knit the file</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to run and test R code from a markdown file. Sometimes you want to knit the whole file and get the PDF or HTML; other times you want to run just a specific bit of code to make sure it’s working correctly.</p>
<p>Every time you knit the file, all R code will be run automatically.</p>
<p>A side note: PDF or HTML? Which is preferable?</p>
<p>I think PDFs are a little more portable and a good default option, and their formatting is best for anything you are going to <em>print out</em> to hand in – it will look nicer and the same content will take up fewer pages.</p>
<p>However, later in the semester we will see how to create some pretty cool interactive graphics in R, and these can only be rendered in HTML. For this class, you can use either one.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-running-r-code-from-an-rmd-file-run-menu" class="section level2">
<h2>Running R Code from an Rmd file: Run Menu</h2>
<p>You can also use shortcuts/buttons to run specific chunk(s). Here is one way to do it (option 1): Use the <em>Run</em> pulldown menu at the top of the markdown file. (Choose the option you want based on what you are trying to do).</p>
<p><img src="images/RunMenu.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-running-code-from-an-rmd-file-shortcut-button" class="section level2">
<h2>Running Code from an Rmd file: Shortcut Button</h2>
<p>Here is another way to use shortcuts/buttons to run only a specific chunk (option 2): Click on the green arrow at the upper right of a code chunk to run the chunk.</p>
<p><img src="images/RunButton.png" width="85%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-running-code-from-an-rmd-file-copy-and-paste" class="section level2">
<h2>Running Code from an Rmd file: Copy and Paste</h2>
<p>Finally, here’s a third way to use shortcuts/buttons (option 3):</p>
<p>Copy the code you want to run, paste to the console window, and hit Enter.</p>
<p>(Or on Windows, place your cursor in the line you want to run and hit ctrl + enter.)</p>
</div>
<div id="section-r-markdown-files-stand-alone" class="section level2">
<h2>R Markdown files stand alone</h2>
<p>We already covered this once, but we’re covering it again because it’s one of the most common student mistakes in Rmd files!</p>
<p>If you run R code in the console or the RStudio GUI (for example, reading in a data set by pasting code into the console or using the <em>Import Dataset</em> button in the <em>Environment</em> tab), <strong>you won’t be able to use the results in your markdown file.</strong> Any and all commands you need, including reading in data, need to be included in the file.</p>
<p>The reverse is also true. If you run just one R code chunk in an Rmd file using the “run” buttons mentioned above, or by copy-pasting into the console, you are effectively running that code in the console. If R gives an error saying it cannot find a certain variable or dataset, the most likely fix is to run the <em>preceding</em> code chunks before the one you’re stuck on.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-reading-in-a-data-file-stored-online" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading in a data file stored online</h2>
<p>You can load online datafiles in .csv format into R using the function <code>read.csv()</code>. The input to <code>read.csv()</code> is the full url where the file is located, in quotation marks. (Single or double quotes – it doesn’t matter which you choose, as they are equivalent in R.)</p>
<p>For example, we will consider a dataset with counts of the numbers of birds of different species seen at different locations in Hawai’i. It is stored at <a href="http://sldr.netlify.com/data/hawaii_birds.csv" class="uri">http://sldr.netlify.com/data/hawaii_birds.csv</a>, and can be read into R using the command below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hi_birds &lt;- read.csv(&#39;http://sldr.netlify.com/data/hawaii_birds.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-when-you-read-in-data-store-it-to-a-named-object" class="section level2">
<h2>When you read in data, store it to a named object</h2>
<p>Note that we didn’t just run the <code>read.csv()</code> function – we assigned the results a <strong>name</strong> so that instead of printing the data table to the screen, R stores the dataset for later use.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hi_birds &lt;- read.csv(&#39;http://sldr.netlify.com/data/hawaii_birds.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Here, we assigned the name <strong>hi_birds</strong> to the dataset using an “assignment arrow” <code>&lt;-</code> (the “arrow” points from the object toward the name).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-reading-in-data-from-google-sheets" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading in data from Google Sheets</h2>
<p>There’s also a simple way to read in data from a Google Sheet.</p>
<p>First, go to the Google Sheet online to prepare it by “publishing it online”.</p>
<p>In the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose “Publish to the Web”:</p>
<p><img src="images/publish-to-web.png" width="500px" /></p>
<p>In the pop-up window, choose to publish your “Entire Document” as a .csv file:</p>
<p><img src="images/publish-as-csv.png" width="500px" /></p>
<p>Finally, copy the resulting link.</p>
<p><img src="images/get-link.png" width="500px" /></p>
<p>You can use <code>read.csv()</code> with this link as input to read your data into R.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-a-few-very-basic-r-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>A few (very) basic R functions</h2>
<p>After reading the data in, you can use R functions to have a look at it, for example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(hi_birds)
glimpse(hi_birds)
nrow(hi_birds)</code></pre>
<p>Try each of the lines of code above in R. What do the functions <code>head()</code>, <code>glimpse()</code>, and <code>nrow()</code> <strong>do</strong>? Try to figure it out based on the output they produce.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, consult R’s built-in help files. Remember, you can access the help for a function by running the code <code>?functionName</code> – for example, if you want help on <code>head()</code>, run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?head</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-reading-in-a-local-data-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Reading in a local data file</h2>
<p>You can also upload your own data file to the server, and then read it in to R using read.csv. The basic process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use spreadsheet software to create the data table</li>
<li>Save the file as a csv file.</li>
<li>Upload the csv file to the RStudio server</li>
<li>Use the <code>read.csv()</code> function to read the file into R</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-tips-for-formatting-a-data-table" class="section level2">
<h2>Tips for formatting a data table</h2>
<p>Your data table should have one row per <strong>observation</strong> (or “<strong>case</strong>”) – the people, animals, places, or things about which data have been collected.</p>
<p>There should be one column for each <strong>variable</strong> observed. Choose short but informative names for your variables (and the values they can take on), and avoid using any special symbols or spaces in the names.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-create-your-own-data-table" class="section level2">
<h2>Create your own data table</h2>
<p>Next you will use any spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets, etc. - your choice) to create a simple data file. For this exercise, we will use some data which represent a random sample of 25 records from the dataset <code>HELPrct</code> from the <code>mosaic</code> package; use the command</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?HELPrct</code></pre>
<p>if you want more info on the dataset as a whole. A brief description of the data is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Researchers collected survey data from people participating in substance-abuse treatment programs. Among many other things, they recorded whether each person was homeless or housed, and also the main substance to which they were addicted (alcohol, cocaine, or heroin, in this study). Of the 25 people in our subsample, 14 were homeless, and of these 6 used alcohol, 3 cocaine, and 5 heroin. Among the 11 housed people, 1 used alcohol, 7 cocaine, and 3 heroin.</strong></p>
<p>Enter these data points into your spreadsheet using the “tips” given previously for data-table formatting. When you are happy with your table, save it in CSV (comma separated values) format.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-uploading-a-file-to-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>Uploading a file to RStudio</h2>
<p>Go to the <em>Files</em> tab in RStudio (lower right). Click <em>Upload</em> and browse to select the file you created. Then, use the <code>read.csv()</code> function to read in the file. Remember to put the file name in quotes, and use &lt;- to assign a name to the dataset! Note that if you made folders in your <em>Files</em> tab and stored the csv file inside one of them, you will have to include the relative path from your Rmd file to your data file, <em>e.g.</em>, “myfolder/myfilename.csv”.)</p>
</div>
<div id="section-a-note-about-printing" class="section level2">
<h2>A note about printing</h2>
<p>When you knit a Rmd file, it will probably automatically open in RStudio’s built-in PDF pre-viewer. If you print from there, it will look awful (blurry). But when you knit, a PDF of the output is also saved in your <em>Files</em> tab. If you go to the <em>Files</em> tab and double click the PDF, it should open in your computer’s normal PDF viewer and you can print it from there…and it will look good.</p>
