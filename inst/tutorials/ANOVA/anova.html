<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>This module introduces <strong>An</strong>alysis <strong>o</strong>f <strong>Va</strong>riance (ANOVA), which allows us to test whether the means of <strong>three or more groups</strong> are all equal. (Like a two-sample t-test for more than two groups).</p>
<p>By the end of the module you will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be able to compute SSG, MSG, SSE, MSE, and the F-ratio, then use the result to find the p-value for an ANOVA</li>
<li>Be able to explain (graphically or verbally) what all the quantities listed above are measuring</li>
<li>Use <code>car::Anova(lm())</code> to carry out an ANOVA in R</li>
<li>Use <code>TukeyHSD()</code> in R to determine which group means are different, <strong>if</strong> an ANOVA has allowed you to reject the null hypothesis that they are all the same</li>
<li>Be able to list the conditions under which ANOVA is reliable and appropriate, and check them in a specific scenario</li>

<h2>Case Study: Gratitude</h2>
<p>A growing body of research has documented the effects that practicing gratitude can have on people – providing not just spiritual and mental-health benefits, but also improving physical health.</p>

<div id="section-dataset" class="section level2">
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>We will dive further into this topic – learning about ANOVA along the way – via a case study where researchers tried to collect data to answer:</p>
<p><strong>“How does gratitude affect peoples’ mental and physical well-being?”</strong></p>
<p>The data are simulated based on the results of a paper published in 2003:</p>
<p><a href="https://moodle.calvin.edu/pluginfile.php/1481445/mod_page/content/1/Counting_blessings_versus_burd.pdf"><img src="images/count-blessings.png" width="450" /></a></p>

</div>
<div id="section-can-we-induce-gratitude" class="section level2">
<h2>Can We Induce Gratitude?</h2>
<p>To understand whether gratitude can <em>cause</em> improvements in mental and physical health and practices, the researchers needed to do a <strong>randomized</strong> study, in which they somehow controlled peoples’ gratitude levels. How did they do <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>First, they recruited nearly 200 college students to participate in their study.</p>
<p>They asked participants to complete a weekly journal, writing lists of things that they were grateful for. 1/3 of study participants were randomly assigned to this group - the <code>gratitude</code> group.</p>
<p>Other participants were asked to write about things that <em>annoyed</em> them instead – this was the <code>hassles</code> group.</p>
<p>Finally, a control group – the <code>events</code> group – just wrote about events in the past week that had affected them (could be either positive or negative).</p>
<p>Before delving into any other questions, the researchers had to verify that the <code>gratitude</code> group <em>actually felt more grateful</em> than the other groups…</p>
<div id="section-more-design-details" class="section level3">
<h3>More Design Details</h3>
<p>In addition to the journals, all the students had to complete weekly surveys about their behavior and state of mind.</p>
<p>For example, they had to state how often (on a scale of 1 to 5) they experienced each of a set of feelings over the preceding week:</p>
<p><img src="anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-pulling-out-gratitude" class="section level3">
<h3>Pulling out Gratitude</h3>
<p>The researchers combined scores from the words <em>thankful</em>, <em>appreciative</em>, and <em>grateful</em> to assess participants’ gratitude. In our dataset, this value is called <code>gratitude_score</code>.</p>
<p><img src="anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>How do the data actually look?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gf_boxplot(gratitude_score ~ group, data = grateful, color = ~group)</code></pre>
<p><img src="anova_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It seems like perhaps the <code>gratitude_score</code> is higher for the <code>gratitude</code> group and lower for the others, but we really need hypothesis test results to have more confidence in our judgment of whether the difference is real or if the differences between groups could just be the result of random sampling variation.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-our-question" class="section level3">
<h3>Our Question</h3>
<p>As Emmons and McCullough did, our first job will be to test whether the mean <code>gratitude_score</code> is the same for all three groups in the study – the <code>gratitude</code> group, the <code>hassles</code> group, and the <code>events</code> group.</p>
<p>This is <em>different</em> from the t-tests we did for comparing means before, because in the t-tests, we compared two and only two groups.</p>
<p>Now, we have <em>more than</em> two groups to compare. (Three, here.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-hypotheses-for-anova" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypotheses for ANOVA</h2>
<p>We want to test:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \mu_{gratitude} = \mu_{events} = \mu_{hassles}\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, our null hypothesis is that the means of <em>all groups</em> are the same. (The <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>s are the true population means for each of the groups.)</p>
<p>The alternate hypothesis is that <em>at least one pair of groups has different means</em>. (There are a lot of different ways for that to be the case, so for ANOVA, often we just write <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span> in words rather than notation).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-test-stat-for-anova-f-ratio" class="section level2">
<h2>Test Stat for ANOVA: F-ratio</h2>
<p>The big challenge here is to come up with a <strong>test statistic</strong> – <em>one number</em> that measures evidence against the null hypothesis that all the group means are the same.</p>
<p><strong>How can we define a good test statistic to measure how different</strong> <em>more than two</em> <strong>numbers are?</strong></p>
<p>The video below will walk through the derivation of the F-ratio statistic. I recommend that you download or print <a href="https://stacyderuiter.github.io/s243-2021/ANOVA-handout.pdf">a worksheet</a> where you can take notes and summarize the material from this video (and other key parts of the tutorial).

<li>We will allocate them randomly to the three groups</li>
<li>For each simulated sample, we will compute <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span></li>

<p><em>You may notice there’s a little mismatch between the simulated sampling distribution and the theoretical F distribution for very small F-values, but…where it counts, in the right tail, the match is very good. So our p-value estimates should be pretty good using this distribution (and for the record, you won’t see this issue so much with <span class="math inline">\(K &gt; 3\)</span> - that is, when there are more groups under comparison)</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-p-value" class="section level2">
<h2>P-value!</h2>
<p>To get the p-value of our test, we just need to find the probability of getting an <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> stat <em>at least as big as ours</em>, in a <span class="math inline">\(F_{2, 193}\)</span> distribution:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pf(11.15, df1 = 2, df2 = 193, lower.tail = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2.61536e-05</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>very</em> small, so we reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: at least one of the pairs of groups in the study had different <code>gratitude_score</code>s.</p>
<p>Side note about sided-ness: since the F statistic is a ratio of sums of squares, it gets bigger and bigger as differences in means between any groups grow (no matter which mean(s) are bigger/smaller than the others). So there is no need to look at “both sides” of the F-distribution or multiply our <code>pf()</code> value by 2; ANOVA is always a 2-sided test. And it is always computed from the “upper” tail only of the F distribution (so we always use <code>lower.tail = FALSE</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-letting-r-do-all-the-work-recap" class="section level2">
<h2>Letting R do all the work (Recap)</h2>
<p><em>This section is labelled “Recap” as it is the one you may want to come back to as a summary/reference.</em></p>
<p>Of course, we won’t do all the calculations by hand each time; there’s an R function to automate it all.</p>
<p>We use <code>car::Anova()</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note: You may see others using <code>anova()</code> or <code>aov()</code>. In the simple case we are considering here, they should all work the same. But in more complicated situations – using ANOVA with multiple regression models or with more than one grouping variable - <code>car::Anova()</code> works and the others can mislead. So we choose this more flexible option.</em></p>
<p>The syntax is a little odd. <code>car::Anova()</code> takes as input a fitted <em>regression</em> model from <code>lm()</code>, with the variable you want the mean of as the <em>response</em> and the group variable as the <em>predictor</em>.</p>
<p>You could do something like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_model &lt;- lm(quantitative_variable_I_want_the_mean_of ~ variable_that_gives_groups, 
               data = my_dataset)
car::Anova(my_model)</code></pre>
<p>Or, putting it all into one line since we don’t really need the fitted <code>lm()</code> object for anything:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_model &lt;- lm(quantitative_variable_I_want_the_mean_of ~ variable_that_gives_groups,

<p><strong>Well done! Now, let’s examine the output.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> – all the quantities that we used in our derivation of the F-statistic are <em>right there in the ANOVA output table</em>! (The numeric values also all match with the ones we’ve previously computed by hand.)</p>
<ul>
<li>The “group” row gives the <span class="math inline">\(SSG\)</span> and its <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> (from which we can get <span class="math inline">\(MSG\)</span>) and then the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> stat and p-value)</li>
<li>The “Residuals” row gives the <span class="math inline">\(SSE\)</span> and its <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> (from which we can get <span class="math inline">\(MSE\)</span>). (<em>Residuals</em> is another statistical term for <em>errors</em>.)</li>
<li>The <code>Sum Sq</code> column corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(SS\)</span> terms</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(MS\)</span> terms are not shown in the table, but can be computed from the <span class="math inline">\(SS\)</span> terms and the degrees of freedom</li>
<li>The <code>F value</code> is the F-ratio (test statistic)</li>
<li>The <code>Pr(&gt;F)</code> is the p-value of the test</li>

<h2>Pairwise Comparisons</h2>
<p><strong>Whaddaya wanna know NOW?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we <strong>do reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span></strong>, like we do here, the test just tells us that <em>at least one</em> pair of means is different.</li>
<li>So here, is the <code>gratitude</code> different from <code>hassles</code>? What about the control, <code>events</code> – is either <code>gratitude</code> or <code>hassles</code> different from that?</li>

</ul>
<div id="section-maybe-a-lot-more-tests" class="section level3">
<h3>Maybe a LOT more tests…</h3>
<ul>
<li>Here, with three groups, we have just three pairs of means to compare</li>

<h3>Pairwise tests corrected for multiple tests</h3>
<p>What if we could do a 2-sample t-test for each pair, but <em>inflate</em> the p-value of each test a little to make up for the number of tests being done?</p>
<p><em>(Well, that’d be great.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Tukey’s pairwise Honest Significant Difference test</strong> (<code>TukeyHSD()</code>) in R does this for us.</p>
<p><em>Note: Why the name Tukey? It was one of many <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~brill/Papers/life.pdf">contributions by John Tukey to statistics (and math and computer science)</a></em></p>
<p>We <strong>only</strong> carry out the <code>TukeyHSD()</code> test <em>after</em> an ANOVA rejects <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and indicates that at least one pair has different means. This restraint – not doing pairwise tests unless we already have evidence there will be at least one pair that are significantly different (plus the Tukey HSD adjustment-of-the-p-values) – helps us avoid Type I errors.</p>
<p>Coding the test in R is simple. The input is the same fitted <code>lm()</code> object you already used for the <code>car::Anova()</code>. You can also specify a <code>conf.level</code> (confidence level) if you want something other than the default 95% confidence.</p>

<p>In the results table,</p>
<ul>
<li>The row labels tell us which means are being compared, and also gives the direction of subtraction</li>
<li>The <code>diff</code> column gives the numeric difference in means for the two groups</li>
<li>The <code>lwr</code> column gives the lower bound of a confidence interval for the difference in means. (If you want a confidence level other than 95%, just change the input <code>conf.level = ...</code> in your call to <code>TukeyHSD()</code>. If you omit it, 95% is the default.)</li>
<li>The <code>upr</code> column gives the upper bound of a CI for the difference in means.</li>
<li>The <code>p adj</code> column gives the p-value of a test with <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span> (against a two-sided alternate).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we see that the <code>gratitude</code> group has higher <code>gratitude_score</code>s than the <code>hassles</code> and <code>events</code> groups, but there is no evidence from the data that <code>hassles</code> and <code>events</code> are different from each other.</p>
<p><em>That’s good news for our researchers - they successfully “induced gratitude” in the <code>gratitude</code> group!</em></p>

<div id="section-practice" class="section level2">
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>Since we’ve now demonstrated that the <code>gratitude</code> group is actually more grateful, we can now look at other hypotheses.</p>
<p>For example, are outlook on life and physical health different between the three groups?</p>
<p>The dataset contains four metrics that might differ between the groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>life_rating</code> is a score measuring positivity about one’s life as a whole</li>
<li><code>week_rating</code> is a score measuring expectations of how good one’s life will be in the coming week</li>
<li><code>illness_score</code> measures the degree to which one experienced physical illness in the past week</li>
<li><code>exercise_hours</code> measures the number of hours spent exercising in the preceding week</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose one of the variables listed above.</p>
<p>Use the dataset <code>grateful</code> and carry out an ANOVA to test whether the mean of your variable is the same for all three groups. If appropriate, follow up with a Tukey HSD test to figure out which pairs of means differ. Be sure to think through what the conclusions of each test will be, in terms of gratitude.</p>

<div id="section-devotion-break" class="section level2">
<h2>Devotion Break</h2>
<p>Colossians 3:12-17 reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We <em>do know</em> that God expects our gratitude of us. The Heidelberg catechism is pretty clear on this requirement too (from Lord’s Day 45):</p>
<p><strong>116. Why is prayer necessary for Christians?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it is the chief part of thankfulness which God requires of us (Psalm 50:14-15), and because God will give His grace and Holy Spirit only to those who earnestly and without ceasing ask them of Him, and render thanks unto Him for them (Matthew 7:7–8; Luke 11:9–10, 13; Matthew 13:12; Ephesians 6:18).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But this can all begin to feel burdensome, being told repeatedly that we <em>should</em> be thankful. It seems so unlikely to be fruitful. Being forced to be grateful – what possible good could that do?</p>
<p>Of course, we can consider that question theologically and get profound answers.</p>
<p>But <em>data tells us too</em>. What happened to the students in the study? <em>Someone forced them to be grateful.</em> And actually, it did them a kind of startling amount of good. How wonderful, that what is <em>required</em> of us could sometimes also be so <em>good</em> for us.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-conditions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>Like all the “shortcuts” we’ve explored in the past few weeks, ANOVA relies on the central limit theorem, and there are some conditions that have to be met in order for it to be an appropriate and reliable method.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Representative sample</strong>. As always, we can only make inferences about a population if we have a representative sample from it.</li>
<li><strong>Independence</strong>. Individual observations should be independent of each other (except for possible differences between groups).</li>
<li><strong>Nearly Normal</strong>. The “nearly normal” condition (as defined previously for t-tests) should hold <em>for every group.</em></li>
<li><strong>Constant Variance.</strong> The variance in all groups should be about the same. As a rule of thumb, the largest group standard deviation should be no more than double the smallest one (group standard deviations differ by no more than a factor of 2).</li>
</ol>
<div id="section-exercise" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Return to the example you just did in R and verify that the ANOVA conditions hold (at least, to the extent that you are able to check them).</p>
<p>You may want to compute the standard deviations of each group. You might also view histograms or check sample sizes in each group.</p>
